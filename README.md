A vagrant box running transifex
===============================

Trying to get [transifex][1] running inside a [Vagrant][2] box.
As an exercise I'm throwing in some [cucumber-puppet][3] and hope to get [puppet-virtualenv][4] working. Use at your own peril. Ideas mostly stolen from [Patrick Debois][5]'s blog.
